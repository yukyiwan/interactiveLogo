        <p>I have over a decade of experience in helping business engage target audience over trending media and channels. These media and channels have been rapidly evolving over time. My focus of late is creating interactive media environments over Web sites, apps and IoT for brands and business ideas to stand out in the crowd, powered by the most up-to-date research and application of user experience (UX), interaction design, prototyping, videos, audios, animations, augmented reality, virtual reality, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and more. </p>

            <h3>Mikaal Abdulla, (CEO, 8 Securities formerly) </h3>
            <p>“As the firm’s founder and CEO, I have worked with Cora for the past two years. She has been instrumental in helping build awareness of our brand, products and services in Hong Kong. She possesses all the qualities we seek in a partner including creativity, flexibility and knowledge of our industry and goals. She is also highly determined and works tirelessly on our behalf. We consider her a member of our team. There is no question that the work she has done to build the image of the firm has resulted in recognition by the top business, financial and technology media. She has earned our utmost respect and trust. We could not be happier with the work she has done for us and we give her our highest recommendation.” </p>

            <h3>Suki Wong, Head of Investor Relations, ANTA Sports (SEHK: 2020)</h3>
            <p>“Cora worked with us in the Amer Sports transaction in 2018/19 where she was the Investor Consortium’s lead communication advisor designing and executing the global communication strategy. Familiar with M&A and antitrust regimes and mechanics, she is a trusted communication advisor for key decision makers at the Consortium. She provided us with spot-on analysis and recommendations, helping us make informed decisions to gain broad trust from the market and stakeholders (media, investors, customers, employees and regulators spanning multiple jurisdictions, etc.) and achieve an ultra-high tender support of 94.48%. I’d recommend her to any company that is planning a high-impact or cross-border transaction with exhibited communication expectations from stakeholders.” </p>

            <h3>Emma Cunningham, Head of Communications (External), Westpac</h3>
            <p>“As the Bank's trusted media adviser in Hong Kong and Greater China, Cora has been a critical member of our team. She has been our key go to expert for strategic advice and issues management in this jurisdiction, entrusted with delivering our communications imperatives. Her support at the 2016 Australia Week in China was a notable stand out. The event was our largest China initiative for the year and she delivered strategic communications counsel to Global Chief Executive Officer. This included throughout her schedule of media and public speaking engagements in Beijing and Shanghai. Her local knowledge and bilingual skills made all the difference.” </p>

            <h3>Jerome Tam, Asia Head of Media Relations, Société Générale</h3>
            <p>“Cora started working for our Bank since 2016 and she’s a joy to work with. She’s a great asset to the team, being able to bring in sound knowledge of the financial market (media and market trends). Her strengths include the attention to details, responsiveness to requests, flexibility and her active listening which is extremely important in providing relevant ideas that help deliver sound results. I would recommend her to someone who’s looking for a seasoned communications consultant in the financial industry.”</p>
